# Project: Meteor Madness – NASA + USGS Data Analysis

## Project Context

Based on information provided by the NASA API and USGS, a visualization and simulation tool for asteroid impacts was created. The tool uses meteorite data such as trajectory, velocity, and size.

This document details the analysis of the datasets provided for the "Meteor Madness" project, a visualization and asteroid impact simulation tool developed in the context of a hackathon. The main goal is to integrate NASA asteroid data with USGS geological data (earthquakes, elevation, and tsunami zones) to simulate and visualize the consequences of an impact.

## How to Use the Meteorite Visualizer

The visualizer allows you to customize the asteroid/meteorite diameter, density, velocity, angle, latitude, and longitude. Once you modify these parameters, the coordinates will appear on the screen so you can visualize the impact on the map.

As part of the visualization features, depending on the impact, three color ranges will appear:  
- **Yellow** → medium impact  
- **Orange** → high impact  
- **Red** → catastrophic impact  

The impact level is measured based on depth range.
